"""
This code defines a set of test cases for a hypothetical Jar class, presumably defined in a module named 'jar'. 
The first test case (test_init()) checks if the initialization of a Jar object sets its default capacity to 12 and the initial size to 0. 
The second test case (test_str()) verifies the string representation of the jar, 
starting with an empty jar and then depositing and checking different quantities of cookies. 
The third test case (test_deposit()) focuses on the deposit functionality, 
checking if the size is updated correctly and if exceeding the capacity raises a ValueError with the appropriate message. 
The fourth test case (test_withdraw()) tests the withdrawal functionality, 
ensuring that the size and string representation are updated accordingly and that attempting to withdraw more cookies than available 
raises a ValueError with the expected message. The tests collectively assess the basic functionalities and error handling of the Jar class.
